## 2. About Project.


The Missing Piece is an application designed to make it easier for puzzle enthusiasts to lend and borrow puzzles. It is primarily aimed at older adults who have a passion for this wonderful hobby and wish to expand their opportunities for enjoyment by temporarily exchanging their own puzzles. This way, they can gain access to a wider variety of puzzles. Please enhance the purpose of this platform through improved communication and provide me with a text in English


## 3. Planning.

The planning was executed using the GitHub Project platform, which provided a robust and efficient environment for managing tasks and collaborating on the project. This allowed for seamless organization, tracking, and enhanced visibility into the project's progress
